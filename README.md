# Analysis of public iCCA gene expression data
This repository contains the code to perform gene co-expression analysis and survival analysis of TERT gene expression in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) RNA sequencing dataset published by Dong et al. 2022 [@Dong2022]. 
Before running the code, the supplementary data file `mmc2.xlsx` must be placed into `data/external` directory. The data file can be downloaded using the following link: https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.ccell.2021.12.006/attachment/779c0570-c6d7-4cd3-8c8e-1058f03b59d0/mmc2.xlsx
